## Credits & Inspiration

This project is inspired by and forked from [UWCS Webring](https://cs.uwatering.com/). Their Github is over [here](https://github.com/JusGu/uwatering?tab=readme-ov-file). I've based this implementation of theirs, but with a slight twist for the Cansbridge Scholars.

Keane currently maintains this site, so if you see any bugs please let me know by making an issue on here.
