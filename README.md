## Widget template

Since every website is unique, we suggest you add your own flair to the lion. We also know that design is hard, so here are some examples to get you started:

#### HTML:

```html
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px;">
    <a href="https://cs.uwatering.com/#your-site-here?nav=prev">←</a>
    <a href="https://cs.uwatering.com/#your-site-here" target="_blank">
        <img src="https://cs.uwatering.com/icon.black.svg" alt="CS Webring" style="width: 24px; height: auto; opacity: 0.8;"/>
    </a>
    <a href="https://cs.uwatering.com/#your-site-here?nav=next">→</a>
</div>
<!-- Replace 'your-site-here' with your actual site URL -->
```

#### JSX:

```jsx
<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '8px' }}>
    <a href='https://cs.uwatering.com/#your-site-here?nav=prev'>←</a>
    <a href='https://cs.uwatering.com/#your-site-here' target='_blank'>
        <img
            src='https://cs.uwatering.com/icon.black.svg'
            alt='CS Webring'
            style={{ width: '24px', height: 'auto', opacity: 0.8 }}
        />
    </a>
    <a href='https://cs.uwatering.com/#your-site-here?nav=next'>→</a>
</div>
// Replace 'your-site-here' with your actual site URL
```

For dark-themed websites, use `icon.white.svg`. Feel free to host the icon locally if you encounter HTTPS issues / styling issues.

## Alternative Icons Sources

- Black: `https://cs.uwatering.com/icon.black.svg`
- White: `https://cs.uwatering.com/icon.white.svg`
- Red: `https://cs.uwatering.com/icon.red.svg`

If none of these quite work for you, feel free to make your own. If you're using React, start with [icon.custom.tsx](./icon.custom.tsx).

## Q&A

#### _I'm not in CS. Can I still join?_

> We're honoured that you're interested in us! If you're a student in UWaterloo, consider joining the [SE Webring](https://se-webring.xyz/) and [ECE Webring](https://ece.engineering/) if you're in these aforementioned programs. We promise they'll also take good care of you :)
>
> If none of these are a fit, make your own! Webrings are a fantastic way to find new people, and don't take much technical skill to create.

#### _Do you accept alumni and post-grad students?_

> Yep, as long as you studied Computer Science or are currently studying it

#### _What about minors, double degrees (ie CS BBA), etc?_

> 👍
